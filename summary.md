###Summary

The PyCon Organizers Manual, an effort started by the 2016 - 2017 Python Software Foundation Board of Directors, is meant to be an evolving document containing information about how to get started organizing a PyCon or other Python conference.

####Notes on Why a PyCon Organizers Manual and How to Read 

This manual is meant to be collection point, unifying the work of previous projects and integrating voices of different segments of the Python community, and hopefully will become a common ground for Python organizers. That being said, this manual is also a work in progress. Anyone is welcome to contribute and offer feedback. If you would like to participate, please read the [how you can contribute](docs/how_to_contribute.md) chapter to get started.
